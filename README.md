To create and add that README to your project, follow these steps:

Create the README file:

In the root directory of your specView client repo, create a new file named README.md.

You can do this by either creating the file manually or running this command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
touch README.md
Add the content:

Open the README.md file in your code editor.

Copy the content I provided in the previous response and paste it into the README.md file.

Save and commit the changes:

After saving the README.md file, use Git to stage and commit the changes:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README to specView client repo"
git push
Check the changes:

Once the file is pushed to your GitHub (or other repository host), the README will automatically be displayed on your repositoryâ€™s main page.
